# Forecasting competition
Project for Smart Distribution Systems course at KU Leuven, Belguim. 

The goal of this assignment is to design a neural network (or a set of neural
networks) to forecast the Belpex wholesale electricity price. 
The dates of these 3 days are not given but one is provided with relevant data
of the 7 preceding days in each case. The final objective is to produce a forecast
that has the smallest Mean Square Error (MSE) possible compared to the real prices
of the 3 days.

## Content
- ``main`` develops functions for Neural Networks creation, training and performance assessment
- ``data_manager`` develops all the functions to process, correct and standarize the solar, wind and price data


## Structure
- ``/data`` contains all the .csv files provided for the assignment commitment

## Report
The report explain how (and why) the authors selected final features and architecture 
as well as include the figures and/or tables that were deem relevant.
It will be available [here]().
